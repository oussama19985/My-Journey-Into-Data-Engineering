# My-Journey-Into-Data-Engineering
This repository serves as digital notepad to document my immersion into data engineering. 

# Context

Being a **data science** and **MLOps** consultant for many years, I have found myself tackling data engineering challenges consistently, and came up with the conclusion that the **data engineering** aspect of a project represents the **foundation** of its success. No matter how refined and performing your ML solution is (example), it remains utterly useless if not layed on a **solid data engineering infrastructure**.      

Data scientists arenâ€™t typically trained to engineer **production-grade data systems**, and
they end up doing this work haphazardly because they lack the support and resources
of a **data engineer**.
# Defining Data Engineering

"Data engineering is the **development, implementation, and maintenance** of systems
and processes that take in **raw data** and produce **high-quality, consistent information**
that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning." -   O'REILLY **Fundamentals of Data Engineering**
